# Business continuity and disaster recovery hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract

In this hands-on lab, you will implement three different environments and use Azure BCDR technologies to achieve three distinct objectives for each environment. These objectives include a migration to Azure, Azure region-to-region failover, and a PaaS implementation using BCDR technologies to ensure high availability of an application.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be able to design and build complex and robust IaaS BCDR solutions.  

## Overview

The Business continuity and disaster recovery hands-on Lab is an exercise that will challenge you to implement a BCDR solution that includes three different environments and uses Azure BCDR technologies to achieve three distinct goals for each environment. These objectives include a migration to Azure, Azure region to region failover using Azure Site Recovery (ASR), and a PaaS implementation using BCDR technologies to ensure high availability of an application.

The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model real-world experiences and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Solution architecture

Below are diagrams of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

### Environment: On-premises (migrate to Azure)

- **Background:** This environment will deploy a Hyper-V instance that will host a Linux VM to simulate a Linux, Apache, PHP, and MySQL (LAMP) based Web application deployed into an on-premises data center on a single VM.

- **Goal using Azure BCDR:** Your goal for this environment will be to migrate this application to Azure IaaS with a one-direction failover.

    ![The on-premises migration diagram includes on-premises, Azure platform, and secondary region sections. On-premises has a Hyper-V host and a Linux on-premises virtual machine. Azure Platform uses Azure Site Recovery. The secondary region has an on-premises Linux VM as well.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image2.png "On-premises migration diagram")

### Environment: Azure IaaS (failover region to region)

- **Background:** This environment will consist of two Azure Virtual Networks deployed to your Primary and Secondary site with an AD domain, IIS Web servers and Microsoft SQL servers that you will configure into a SQL Always On Availability Group.

- **Goal using Azure BCDR:** Your goal for this environment is to have the ability to have a one-click failover process using Azure Site Recovery in either direction. The users will have one URL that they will use to connect to your application regardless of where the application is running.

    ![Diagram of the Azure IaaS failover region to region solution.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image3.png "Azure IaaS failover region to region solution")


## Requirements

1. An Azure Subscription with full access to the environment.

## Exercise 1: Deploy Azure environments

Duration: 15 minutes (Deployments can take as long as 75 minutes)

In this exercise, you will use Azure ARM templates to deploy the following environments used in this HOL:

- **Azure IaaS:** This environment will consist of two Virtual Networks deployed to your Primary and Secondary site with an AD Domain, IIS Web Servers and Microsoft SQL Servers that you will configure into a SQL Always On Availability Group.

- **On-premises:** This environment will deploy a Hyper-V Host that will host a Linux VM to simulate a web application deployed into on-premises data center on a single VM. Your goal for this environment will be to migrate this application to Azure IaaS with a one-direction failover.


### Task 1: Deploy Azure IaaS

    ![Screenshot of the Windows PowerShell ISE button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image71.png "Windows PowerShell ISE button")

33. Open the file `C:\HOL\Deployments\ASRRunBookVariable.ps1`. Review the script and enter the automation account name you created earlier. Then select the green play button to execute the script. You will need to authenticate to Azure.

    ![In the Windows PowerShell ISE window, the green play button is selected, and a call out points to \"Your-Automation-Account-Name-Here\" in the script window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image72.png "Windows PowerShell ISE window")

    >**Note**: If you are using an account that has multiple subscriptions you may need to change the context of your login. You can comment out the **Login-AzureRmAccount** command in the script and complete the login and the use the **Get-AzureRmSubscription** and **Select-AzureRmSubscription** cmdlets to create the proper context for this HOL. For help, you can review this article: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps?view=azurermps-5.1.1> & <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/manage-subscriptions-azureps?view=azurermps-5.1.1>.

34. Once the script has run, you will see the following output from PowerShell ISE. This script created a variable that will be used with the PowerShell Runbook in Azure Automation to help with the Failover and Failback of the Azure IaaS environment.

    ![Screenshot of PowerShell ISE output.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image73.png "PowerShell ISE output")

35. Move back to the Azure portal and locate the **Azure Automation** account. Select the **Variables** link in the **Shared Resources** section.

    ![In the Automation Account blade, Variables is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image74.png "Automation Account blade")

36. Notice that the variable **BCDRIaaSPlan** has been created. This variable will be used along with ASR to orchestrate part of the failover.

    ![In the Automation Account blade, under Name, a call out points to BCDRIaaSPlan.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image75.png "Automation Account blade")

>**Note:** When you configure the ASR Recovery Plan for the IaaS deployment you will use the SQL Runbook as a Pre-Failover Action and the Web Runbook as a Post-Failover action. They will run both ways and have been written to take the "Direction", of the failover into account when running.

## Exercise 3: Configure environments for failover

Duration: 90 minutes

In this exercise, you will configure the two environments to use BCDR technologies found in Azure. Each environment has unique configurations that must be completed to ensure their availability in the event of a disaster.

>**Note**: Make sure prior to starting each task that the deployment that you started in Exercise 1 has completed for each as you come to that task. This can be determined, but reviewing the deployments for each Resource group in the Azure portal. If it says Succeeded, then you can begin the task.

### Task 1: Configure on-premises to Azure IaaS failover

In this task, the **OnPremVM** will be configured to replicate to Azure and be ready to failover to the **BCDRIaaSSecondarySite**. This will consist of configuring your Hyper-V host with the ASR provider and then enabling replication of the VM to the Recovery Service Vault.

1.  From the Azure portal, open the **BCDRRSV** Recovery Services Vault located in the **BCDRAzureSiteRecovery** resource group.

2.  Select **Site Recovery** in the **Getting Started** area of **BCDRRSV** blade.

    ![In the Recovery Services vault blade, under Getting Started, Site Recovery is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image76.png "Recovery Services vault blade")

3.  Next, select **Prepare Infrastructure** in the **For On-Premises Machines** section. This will start you down a path of various steps to configure your VM that is running on Hyper-V on-premises to be replicated to Azure.

    ![In the For On-Premises Machines section, Prepare Infrastructure is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image77.png "For On-Premises Machines section")

4.  On **Step 1 Protection Goal** select the following inputs and then select **OK**:

    - **Where are your machines located?**: On-premises

    - **Where do you want to replicate your machines to?**: To Azure

    - **Are you performing a migration?**: No

    - **I understand, but I would like to continue with Azure Site Recovery**: *checked*

    - **Are your machines virtualized?**: Yes, with Hyper-V [Your VM is running as a nested VM in Azure].

## Exercise 4: Simulate failovers

Duration: 75 minutes

Now, that your applications have been made ready for high-availability and BCDR you will now simulate their capabilities. First, you will failover the **Azure IaaS environment** from your **Primary** to **Secondary** region. Next, you will failover the **On-Premises** environment to Azure.  Finally, you will failback the Azure IaaS environment from the **Secondary** site to the **Primary** site.

### Task 1: Failover Azure IaaS region to region

![The Azure IaaS region to region failover diagram displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image317.png "Azure IaaS region to region failover diagram")

1.  Using the Azure portal, open the **BCDRIaaSPrimarySite** resource group. Locate the Front Door Frontend Host URL and select it to ensure that the application is up and running from the Primary Site. Pin the Front Door to your dashboard for easy access to this URL or make a favorite in your browser.

    ![The Frontend host link is called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image318.png "Frontend host")

2.  From the Azure portal, open the **BCDRRSV** Recovery Services Vault located in the **BCDRAzureSiteRecovery** resource group.

6.  On the warning about No Test Failover, select **I understand the risk, Skip test failover**.

    ![A warning displays that no test failover has been done in the past 180 days, and recommends that you do one before a failover. At the bottom, the I understand and skip test failover checkbox is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image322.png "Failover warning")

7.  Review the Failover direction. Notice that **From** is the **Primary** site, and **To** is the **Secondary** site. Select **OK**.

    ![call outs in the Failover blade point to the From and To fields.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image323.png "Failover blade")

8.  After the Failover is initiated, close the Failover blade and move to **Recovery Plans (Site Recovery)**. Select the **Failover** job to monitor the progress.

    ![Failover is selected in the Site Recover jobs blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image324.png "Site Recover jobs blade")

9.  You can monitor the progress of the Failover from this panel.

    >**Note:** Do not make any changes to your VMs in the Azure portal during this process. Allow ASR to take the actions and wait for the failover notification prior to moving on to the next step. You can open another portal view in a new browser tab and review the output of the Azure Automation Jobs, by opening the jobs and selecting Output.
    >
    >![Output is selected on the Job blade, and information displays in the Output blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image326.png "Job and Output blades")

19. The Application running on the WEBVM1 and WEBVM2 is now responding from the **Secondary** site. Make sure to select the current Policy Offerings to ensure that there is connectivity to the SQL Always-On group that was also failed over in the background.

    ![The Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image335.png "Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage ")

    ![The Index webpage displays the insurance options.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image336.png "Index webpage")

21. Select **DNS Name URL**. The site loads immediately and is failed over. Web site users will always be using this DNS URL, so there is no change in how they access the site even though it is failed over. There **will** be downtime as the failover happens, but once the site is back online the experience for them will be no different than when it is running in the **Primary** site.

    ![The Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage displays with a call out pointing to the URL in the address bar.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image338.png "Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage")

>**Optional task**: If you wish, you can RDP to **SQLVM3** and open the SQL Management Studio to review the Failed over **BCDRAOG**. You will see that **SQLVM3** which is running the **Secondary** site is now the Primary Replica.

22. Now, that you have successfully failed over you need to prep ASR for the Failback. Move back to the **BCDRSRV** Recovery Service Vault using the Azure portal. Select **Recovery Plans** on the ASR dashboard.

    ![Recovery Plans is highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image339.png "Recovery Plans")

    ![In the Public IP address blade, a call out points to the DNS name.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image393.png "Public IP address blade")

17. The Application running on the **WEBVM1** and **WEBVM2** is now responding from the **Primary** Site. Make sure to select the current **Policy Offerings** to ensure that there is connectivity to the SQL Always On group that was also failed back to primary in the background.

    ![The Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage displays with a call out pointing to the URL in the address bar.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image394.png "Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage")

    ![On the Index - Policy Connect tab webpage coverage options display.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image395.png "Index - Policy Connect tab webpage")

19. Select the **Frontend host**. The site load immediately and is failed over. The users will always be using this DNS URL, so they there is no change in how they access the site even though it is failed over.

    ![Screenshot of the Frontend host link.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image397.png "Frontend host link")

    ![The Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage displays with a call out pointing to the URL in the address bar.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image338.png "Contoso Insurance PolicyConnect webpage")

20. Now, that you have successfully failed back you need to prep ASR for the Failover again. Move back to the **BCDRSRV** Recovery Service Vault using the Azure portal. Select Recovery Plans on the ASR dashboard.

    ![A Recovery Plans tile with the number 1 displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image339.png "Recovery Plans tile")

21. The BCDRIaaSPlan will show as **Failover completed**. Select the Plan.

    ![In the BCDRSRV blade a call out points to the failover completed message.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image340.png "BCDRSRV blade")

22. Notice that now 2 VMs are shown in the **Source**.

23. Select **More**, then select **Re-protect**.

    ![In the BCDRSRV blade, the More ellipses is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image342.png "BCDRSRV blade")

24. On the **Re-protect** screen review the configuration and then select **OK**.

    ![The BCDRIaaSPlan blade displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image398.png "BCDRIaaSPlan blade")

25. The portal will submit a deployment. This process will take some time, by first committing the failover and then synchronizing the **WEBVM1** and **WEBVM2** back to the **Primary** Site. Once this process is complete, then you will be able to Fail over again from the **Primary** to **Secondary** site from the perspective of ASR.

26. Select **Resource groups** in the Azure portal and notice that two new Resource groups have been created with -asr in their names. These are used by ASR for the Failover and Failback, so they should be left in place.

    ![A list of Resource groups displays, two of which are: BCDRIaaSPrimarySite-asr, and BCDRIaaSPrimarySite-asr-1. ](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image399.png "Resource groups")

27. Next, you need to reset the SQL AOG environment to ensure a proper failover. To do this open Remote Desktop to **BCDRDC1** and then jump to **SQLVM1** using Remote desktop.

28. Once connected to **SQLVM1** open SQL Management Studio and Connect to **SQLVM1**. Expand the **Always On Availability Group**s and then right-click on **BCDRAOG** and then select **Show Dashboard**.

    ![In SQL Management Studio, the right-click menu for BCDRAOG (Primary) displays, and Show Dashboard is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image198.png "SQL Management Studio")

29. Notice that all the Replica partners are now Synchronous Commit with Automatic Failover Mode. You need to manually reset **SQLVM3** to be **Asynchronous** with **Manual Failover**.

    ![The Availability group dashboard displays with SQLVM3 and its properties called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image400.png "Availability group dashboard")

30. Right-click the **BCDRAOG** and select **Properties**.

    ![In Object Explorer, the right-click menu for BCDRAOG displays with Properties selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image401.png "Object Explorer")

31. Change **SQLVM3** to **Asynchronous** and **Manual Failover** and select **OK**.

    ![In the Availability Group Properties window, under Availability Replicas, the SQLVM3 server role is secondary, availability mode is asynchronous commit, and failover mode is manual.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image402.png "Availability Group Properties window")

32. Show the Availability Group Dashboard again. Notice that they change has been made and that the AOG is now reset.

    ![The Availability group dashboard displays, with SQLVM3 and its properties called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image403.png "Availability group dashboard")

>**Note:** This task could have been done using the Azure Automation script during Failback, but more DBAs would prefer a good, clean failback and then do this manually once they are comfortable with the failback.

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 15 minutes

There are many items that were created as a part of this lab, and they should be deleted once you no longer desire to retain the environments.

### Task 1: Disable replication in the recovery services vault

1.  To clean up the environment, you must first disable the replication of the **WEBVM1, WEBVM2** and **OnPremVM** in the **BCDRSRV** Recovery Service Vault. Open **BCDRSRV** in the Azure portal and select **Replicated Items** in the **Protected Items** area.

    ![Under Protected items, Replicated items is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image404.png "Protected items section")

2.  Select the **Ellipse** next to each replicated item and then select **Disable Replication**. On the following screen select **OK**.

    ![From the ellipses menu, Disable Replication is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Businesscontinuityanddisasterrecoveryimages/media/image405.png "Disable Replication option")

3.  After this process is completed you can move on to the next task.

### Task 2: Delete all BCDR resource groups

1.  Using the Azure Portal delete each of the BCDR Resource Groups that you created:

    | **Resource Group Name** | **Location** |
    |----------|:-------------:|
    | **BCDRAzureAutomation** | Your Location |
    | **BCDRAzureSiteRecovery** | Secondary |
    | **BCDRIaaSPrimarySite** | Primary |
    | **BCDRIaaSSecondarySite** | Secondary |
    | **BCDRLabRG** | Your Location |
    | **BCDROnPremPrimarySite** | Primary |
    | **BCDROnPremPrimarySite-asr** | Primary |
    | **BCDROnPremPrimarySite-asr-1** | Primary |
    | **BCDRPaaSPrimarySite** | Primary |
    | **BCDRPaaSSecondarySite** | Secondary |

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.

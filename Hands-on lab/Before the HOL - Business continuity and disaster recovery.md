# Business continuity and disaster recovery before the hands-on lab setup guide 

## Requirements

- Laptop or tablet, internet browser, reliable and available internet connection

- Azure Subscription with full access to the environment.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 20 minutes


### Task 1:  Determine where you will run the lab exercises.

You will need a workstation with the following:

- Azure Powershell
- Azure CLI
- RDP
- SSH
- Visual Studio Code (optional)

If you choose to use your personal workstation, 

1. Download the zipped Hands-on Lab Step by Step student files at the following link: [Student Files](https://github.com/larryms/ASR-Workshop/blob/master/Hands-on%20lab/StudentFiles/StudentFiles.zip?raw=true).

2.  Extract the files to a directory here **C:\\HOL** on LABVM.

Alternatively, if you do not have a laptop with these pre-reqs, proceed with the  task1 to create a lab vm.


### Task 2: Create a virtual machine to execute the lab

**Only do these steps if you are creating a LABVM.  If not, proceed to task 3.**

1.  Launch a browser and navigate to the Azure Global portal at <https://portal.azure.com>. Once prompted, login with your Microsoft Azure credentials. If prompted, choose whether your account is an Organization  or Microsoft account.

2.  Select **+Create a resource**, in the search box start typing **Visual Studio Community** and press **Enter**. Select the **Visual Studio Community 2017 (latest updates) on Windows Server 2016 (64)**.

    >**Note**: Ensure that you select the exact image name identified above. Failure to do so may result in problems successfully completing the BCDR HOL.

3.  In the returned search results, select the latest image name. Leave the *Select a Deployment Model* chooser on **Resource Manager**.

    ![In the Everything blade, Visual Studio Community 2017 (latest release) on Windows Server 2016 (x64) is selected.](images/Setup/image5.png "Everything blade")

4.  Select **Create**.

5.  Apply the following configuration items on the Basics tab and select **OK**:

    -   **Password**: demo@pass123

    ![Credentials fields are called out in the Windows Security Credentials section.](images/Setup/image11.png "Windows Security Credentials section")

14. You will be presented with a Remote Desktop Connection warning because of a certificate trust issue. Select **Yes** to continue with the connection.

    ![The Remote Desktop Connection Warning dialog box displays, letting you know that the remote computer's identity cannot be verified, and asking if you want to connect anyway.](images/Setup/image12.png "Remote Desktop Connection Warning dialog box")

15. When logging on for the first time, you may be prompted about Windows network discovery. Select **No**.

    ![The Networks pop-up displays, asking if you want to turn on network discovery.](images/Setup/image13.png "Networks pop-up")

16. Notice that Server Manager opens by default. On the left, select **Local Server** (LABVM).

    ![On the Server Manager menu, Local Server is selected.](images/Setup/image14.png "Server Manager menu")

17. On the right side of the pane, select **Off** next to **IE Enhanced Security Configuration**.

    ![IE Enhanced Security Configuration is set to Off, and is selected.](images/Setup/image15.png "IE Enhanced Security Configuration option")

18. Change to **Off** for both Administrators and Users then select **OK**.

    ![In the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration dialog box, Administrators is set to Off, and Users is set to Off.](images/Setup/image16.png "Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration dialog box")

### Task 2: Install Azure PowerShell 'Az' commands

1. Open a PowerShell command-line (be sure to *Run as Administrator*).

2. In the PowerShell command-line, run the following command to install the new Azure PowerShell 'Az' commands:

    ```
    Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber
    ```

    > Note: If you have any errors installing the Azure 'Az' PowerShell commands, then reference the following article:
    > <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/how-to-migrate-from-azurerm-to-az-in-azure-powershell/>.

### Task 3: Download hands-on support files to LABVM

1.  Download the zipped Hands-on Lab Step by Step student files at the following link: [Student Files](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Business-continuity-and-disaster-recovery/blob/master/Hands-on%20lab/StudentFiles/StudentFiles.zip?raw=true).

2.  Extract the files to a directory here **C:\\HOL** on LABVM.



### Task 3: Create Azure Resource Groups

In this task, you will select **Primary** and **Secondary** Azure regions that will be used for the remainder of the BCDR HOL. The **Primary** region should be able to **support V3 virtual machine** sizes, and then you should select the **Secondary** region based on the region pair assigned by Microsoft. Use the Products available by region webpage to determine your **Primary** site: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/services/>. Once you have selected the Primary site,  review the BCDR page to find your Primary Site's Region Pair: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions>.

>**Note:** The examples in this HOL Guide use the following regions: **Primary:** East US 2 and **Secondary**: Central US. For this lab be sure to use these regions as they are validated to work with all the Azure features / services used throughout this lab.


Creating the resource groups through the Azure portal can be tedious.  As a shortcut, you may use the following cli commands to quickly create them:  (Tip:  use the Azure cloud shell to run these commands)

```
az group create --name BCDRLabRG --location CentralUS

az group create --name BCDRIaaSPrimarySite --location EastUS2
az group create --name BCDRIaaSSecondarySite --location CentralUS
az group create --name BCDRAzureAutomation --location EastUS
az group create --name BCDRAzureSiteRecovery --location CentralUS
az group create --name BCDROnPremPrimarySite --location EastUS2
```

Alternatively, if you'd like to go through the steps in the Azure portal, run through the following tasks:

1.  From the **LABVM**, open Internet Explorer and connect to the Azure portal at: <https://portal.azure.com>.

2.  Select **Resource groups**, then select **+Add**.

    ![On the Azure Portal Resource groups blade, the Add button is selected.](images/Setup/image23.png "Azure Portal, Resource groups blade")

3.  Complete the **Resource group** blade using the following inputs and select **Review + Create** and **Create**:

    - **Resource group name**: BCDRIaaSPrimarySite

    - **Subscription**: Select your subscription.

    - **Resource group location**: East US 2 (Primary region)

    ![In the Resource group blade, fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Setup/image24.png "Resource group blade")

    >**Note:** It's very important to use these exact names. Changing the names of the Resource groups will impact the HOL setup and could cause you not to be able to complete the lab.

4.  Select **Resource groups**, then select **+Add**.

    ![On the Azure Portal Resource groups blade, the Add button is selected.](images/Setup/image23.png "Azure Portal, Resource groups blade")

5.  Complete the **Resource group** blade using the following inputs and select **Review + Create** and **Create**.

    -   **Resource group name**: BCDRIaaSSecondarySite

    -   **Subscription**: Select your subscription.

    -   **Resource group location**: Central US (Secondary region)

        ![In the Resource group blade, fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Setup/image25.png "Resource group blade")

6.  Continue to add the resource groups below to support the HOL:

    | **Resource Group Name** | **Location** |
    |----------|-------------|
    | **BCDRAzureAutomation** | Any available site (other than your Primary or Secondary) regions |
    | **BCDRAzureSiteRecovery** | Central US (Secondary) |
    | **BCDROnPremPrimarySite** | East US 2 (Primary) |
    | **BCDRPaaSPrimarySite** | East US 2 (Primary) |
    | **BCDRPaaSSecondarySite** | Central US (Secondary) |

7.  Once all the resource groups have been created, review all the resource groups for this HOL. **It is critical to ensure that the spelling is correct and that they are in the correct Azure Regions (Primary or Secondary)**.

    >**Note:** If for some reason there is an error, delete the erroneous resource group  and recreate it.

8.  Here is the Azure Portal with each of the resource groups created in the correct Azure Region:

    ![In the Resource groups blade, various resource groups and their locations are listed.](images/Setup/image26.png "Resource groups blade")

You should follow all steps provided *before* starting the Hands-on Lab.
